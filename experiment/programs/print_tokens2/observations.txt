// print_tokens2

- Some mutants are considered equivalente because we do not have test
  cases in which the file is entered through stdin. Only real files

- This program has a fault. When the size of an identifier is larger
  than 80 chars it overflows teh variable buffer. We fixed the easiest
  way possible: used a buffer with 800 chars instead of 80. Of course
  if a file has a identifier larger than 800 it will overflow again.
  But this is not the case for any of the test cases so we are ok.
